I had already done the task that is given

In task 1: To solve the problem where the starting time and duration that is not aligned to the sampling rate, I calculated the value using the modulo operation in order to obtain the value that I needed to compensate in order to make sure the time tallies with the sampling rate.

In task 3: I used a nested while loop to place the pulse at the right position, I know that this method isn't the fastest and may consumes alot of memory so if there is a different approach / a more efficient way to code, please teach me about it.
